//Mediator pattern is useful when the communication logic between objects is complex, we can have a central point of communication that takes care of communication logic.
//Java Message Service (JMS) uses Mediator pattern along with Observer pattern to allow applications to subscribe and publish data to other applications.
//We should not use mediator pattern just to achieve lose-coupling because if the number of mediators will grow, then it will become hard to maintain them.
