//Memento pattern is simple and easy to implement, one of the thing needs to take care is that Memento class should be accessible only to the Originator object. 
//Also in client application, we should use caretaker object for saving and restoring the originator state.
//We can use Serialization to achieve memento pattern implementation that is more generic rather than Memento pattern where every object needs to have itâ€™s own Memento class implementation.
//One of the drawback is that if Originator object is very huge then Memento object size will also be huge and use a lot of memory.
