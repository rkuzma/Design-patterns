//Decorator design pattern is helpful in providing runtime modification abilities and hence more flexible. Its easy to maintain and extend when the number of choices are more.
//The disadvantage of decorator design pattern is that it uses a lot of similar kind of objects (decorators).
//Decorator pattern is used a lot in Java IO classes, such as FileReader, BufferedReader etc.
